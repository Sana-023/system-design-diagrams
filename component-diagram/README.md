# Component Diagram

Component diagram for a food ordering system showing the main services, databases, and external integrations.

## Description
The diagram illustrates how the system is divided into multiple components connected through an API Gateway.  
Each component is responsible for a specific function in the system.

Main components:
- Account service
- Food menu service
- Recipe menu service
- Order service
- Order processing
- Order history
- Logging component

## External Systems
The system integrates with several external services:
- Payment system
- Delivery system
- SMS system
- Email system

## Databases
Each major component is connected to its own database, such as:
- User database
- Menu database
- Order database
- History database
- Log database

## Purpose
This diagram demonstrates:
- Separation of system responsibilities into components
- Integration with external services
- Understanding of service-based architecture
